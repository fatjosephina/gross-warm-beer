# Project 'Gross Warm Beer'
## Overview
'Gross Warm Beer' is a first-person puzzle game for PC.
## Objective
The player must manoeuver a small ball into a lit hole by controlling the platform on which the ball rests. The ball must not go into the other, unlit holes. Every time the ball goes into a lit hole, the player gets points and gets to keep playing. The ball going into an unlit hole is considered a failure. The player must try to get as many points as possible before losing.
## Gameplay
The two ends of the platform are controlled with the analog sticks on a gamepad or with the keys of a keyboard. Each analog stick or pair of keys can only move one end of the platform vertically. When the ball goes in a hole, the platform returns to the bottom of the screen and the ball respawns.
## Player Character
The player character is the player. There are no characters explicitly mentioned in the game.
