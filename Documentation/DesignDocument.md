# Project 'Gross Warm Beer'
## Overview
'Gross Warm Beer' is a first-person puzzle game for PC.
## Objective
The player must manoeuver a small ball into a lit hole by controlling the platform on which the ball rests. The ball must not go into the other, unlit holes. Every time the ball goes into a lit hole, the player gets points and gets to keep playing. The ball going into an unlit hole is considered a failure. The player must try to get as many points as possible before losing.
## Gameplay
The two ends of the platform are controlled with the analog sticks on a gamepad or with the keys of a keyboard. Each analog stick or pair of keys can only move one end of the platform vertically. When the ball goes in a hole, the platform returns to the bottom of the screen and the ball respawns.
## Player Character
The player character is the player. There are no characters explicitly mentioned in the game.
## What Button Should Move?
We are developing on mouse and keyboard, so no matter what platform we release the game on, we need to have mouse and keyboard controls so that we can test and develop on PC.
Commonly games use WASD and the arrow keys, so we could use those keys.
Another option could be up and down arrows on keyboard and left and right click on the mouse.
In the interest of moving development forward quickly, we will use WASD and the arrow keys for now.
