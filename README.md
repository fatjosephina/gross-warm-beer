Repository for Intro to Game Dev project "Ice Cold Beer"
Project 'Gross Warm Beer' is an "Ice Cold Beer" inspired video game. The player must manoeuver a ball into a series of lit up holes in order to accumulate points. Meanwhile, the ball must not go into unlit holes. If it does, the player loses.
